This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(googleVis)
op <- options(gvis.plot.tag = "chart")
library(survey)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
detach("package:plyr", unload=TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape)
library(plotrix)
library(RColorBrewer)

source("lib/jmd2228_functions.R")
population <- prepare_data()
#had_child_t_test(population)
had_child_bar_chart(population)
#childs_parents_nativity()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
